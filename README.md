<h2>How To Use Carfree</h2>

<h3>Colour Schema</h3>
<ul>
<li>A light blue circle indicates a radius around your starting location that is bikeable (less than 7km, 30 minutes).</li>
<li>Green markings are roads and paths separated from motor vehicles.</li>
<li>Roads that are outlined in yellow are arterial roads that require more caution, and might want to be avoided if you expect vehicles to travel at high speeds.</li>
<li>Roads that are outlined in red are designated highways. Unless you know they are ridable, they should be avoided.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever route you take, always ride with due care. And have fun!</p>

<h3>Plan A Trip</h3>
<p><strong>Plan A Trip</strong> sets up your travel mode (Cycling or Transit), determines your starting position, and lets you add a destination to your trip.</p>

<p>Search for destinations on addresses, names, or categories of places. Carfree will prioritize results according to relevance and proximity to your starting position.</p>

<p>If travelling on a bike, you can add more than one destination. An ideal route will be calculated. Travelling by Transit allows for one destination only.</p>

<h3>See What's Nearby</h3>
<p><strong>See What's Nearby</strong> to see the kinds places near your starting location, organized into categories. These places are within 7km, or approximately a 30 minute bicycle trip, from your starting location. This is useful for finding types of places, without knowing an exact name or address.</p>

<h3>Show Route Details</h3>
<p>When a destination has been selected, <strong>Show Route Details</strong> will show you directions to get there.</p>
